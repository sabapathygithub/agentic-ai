       "Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that are designed to take action and make decisions autonomously, without explicit programming or supervision. The term \"agentic\" comes from the philosophy of agent theory, which studies autonomous entities that can act in their own interests.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the context of AI, agentic AI aims to create machines that can:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Learn and adapt through experience\n",
       "2. Discover and pursue goals without being explicitly programmed for them\n",
       "3. Make decisions based on complex, dynamic environments\n",
       "\n",
       "Agentic AI has many potential applications, including:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Autonomous vehicles: self-driving cars that can navigate through complex roads and situations\n",
       "2. Robotics: robots that can interact with their environment and adapt to changing conditions\n",
       "3. Healthcare: intelligent systems that can diagnose and treat patients autonomously\n",
       "4. Financial markets: AI-powered trading platforms that can act on market trends\n",
       "\n",
       "However, creating agentic AI raises many challenges, including:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Ensuring safety and trustworthiness\n",
       "2. Managing uncertainty and unexpected outcomes\n",
       "3. Avoiding bias and ensuring fairness\n",
       "4. Balancing human agency with machine autonomy\n",
       "\n",
       "Researchers from the Future of Life Institute (FLI) introduced the term \"agentic AI\" in a 2017 paper, which highlighted the potential risks and benefits of creating autonomous AI systems.\n",
       "\n",
       "More recently, the concept has gained significant attention in the wake of the OpenAI GPT-4 (formerly known as AlphaFold 2), L LaMDA, and other advanced language models. These models demonstrate some level of agentic capabilities but also raise concerns about alignment, control, and human interest.\n",
       "\n",
       "Agentic AI is an active area of research, with many researchers exploring its potential applications while working to mitigate its risks.\n",
