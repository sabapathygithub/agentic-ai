The side advocating for the introduction of strict law regulation against the usage of LLMs is more convincing because they effectively demonstrate that unregulated use poses significant risks to privacy, data security, misinformation control, and ethical AI development. They convincingly argue that regulatory frameworks are essential to enforce accountability, mitigate misuse, and promote safe and responsible innovation. While the opposing side rightly highlights the importance of innovation and self-regulation, these arguments do not outweigh the substantive and immediate risks that only enforceable laws can adequately address. Hence, the merits of ensuring safety, trust, and ethical use through strict regulation make the pro-regulation stance the stronger and more compelling argument in this debate.
